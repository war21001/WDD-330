        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <h2>Properties and Methods</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript functions can have their own properties and methods - ex.  length property</li>
                <li>call() sets value of 'this' inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument </li>
                <li>apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument</li>
                <li>able to add own properties to functions in the same way that can add properties to any object</li>
                <li>memoization - provides result caching</li>
               
            </ul>
        <h2>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>IIFE - pronounced 'iffy'</li>                 
                <li>anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined</li>
                <li>This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function).</li>
                <li>The function also has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses</li>      
                <li><pre>(function(){
                    const temp = 'World';
                    console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);
                    })();
                    << 'Hello World'</pre> </li>            
                <li>useful way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up within the scope of the function. This means the global namespace is not polluted with lots of variable names</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Temporary Variables</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>no way to remove a variable from a scope once it’s been declared</li>
                <li>Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.</li> 
            </ul>        
        <h4>Initialization Code</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for again</li>
                
            </ul>
        <h4>Safe Use of Strict Mode</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>if you’re using other people’s code, there’s no guarantee that they’ve coded in strict mode.</li>
                <li> recommended way to use strict mode is to place all your code inside an IIFE</li>
                <li><pre>(function() {
                    'use strict';
                
                // All your code would go inside this function
                
                })();</pre></li>      
                <li>This ensures that only your code inside the IIFE is forced to use strict mode</li>  
            </ul>    
        <h4>Creating Self-contained Code Blocks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any other part of the program</li>
            </ul> 
        <h2>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself.</li>
                <li>If the function is also assigned to another variable, this variable will maintain the original function definition and not be rewritten.</li>
                <li>Lazy Definition Pattern -If any properties have previously been set on the function, these will be lost when the function redefines itself.</li>
            </ul>   
        <h4>Init-Time Branching</h4>            
            <ul>                
                <li>Technique can be used with the feature detection to create functions that rewrite themselves, known as init-time branching.</li>
                <li></li>  
                <li></li>
                <li></li> 
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Recursive Functions</h2>            
            <ul>                
                <li>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met.</li>
                <li>useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved</li>  
            </ul> 
        <h2>Callbacks</h2>            
            <ul>                
                <li>functions that are passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Event-driven Asynchronous Programming</h4>            
            <ul>                
                <li>JavaScript is a single-threaded environment, which means only one piece of code will ever be processed at a time. </li>
                <li>By using callbacks, we ensure that waiting for these tasks to complete doesn't hold up the execution of other parts of the program. Once the task has been completed, the callback will be invoked before returning to the rest of the program.</li>  
                <li>Error-first Callbacks - callbacks have two arguments. The first is the error argument, which is an error object provided if something goes wrong when completing the operation. The second argument is any data returned by the operation that can be used in the body of the callback.</li>
                <li></li> 
            </ul>
        <h4>Promises</h4>            
            <ul>                
                <li> Promises don't do anything that can't already be achieved using callbacks, but they help simplify the process, and avoid the convoluted code that can result from using multiple callbacks.</li>
                <li>The Promise Life Cycle
                    <ul>                
                        <li>When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to be pending.</li>
                        <li>It remains in this state while the operation is taking place. At this stage, the promise is said to be unsettled. </li>  
                        <li>Once the operation has completed, the promise is said to have been settled.</li>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.</li> 
                            <li>Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>A promise is created using a constructor function.</li>
                        <li>function called an executor as an argument. The executor initializes the promise and starts the asynchronous operation. It also accepts two functions as arguments: the resolve() function is called if the operation is successful, and the reject() function is called if the operation fails</li>
                        <li><pre>const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
                            // initialization code goes here
                            if (success) {
                                resolve(value);
                            } else {
                                reject(error);
                            }
                        });</pre></li>
                <li></li> 
                    </ul>
